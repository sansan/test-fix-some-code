# Task original

Create a RESTful API with an endpoint for transaction commission calculation. The API must use JSON format for requests and responses.

**Request (Transaction) examples**

_1st example_

```
{
  "date": "2021-01-01",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "client_id": 42
}
```

_2nd example_

```
{
  "date": "2021-01-01",
  "amount": "200.40",
  "currency": "USD",
  "client_id": 42
}
```

**Response (Commission) example**

```
{
  "amount": "0.05",
  "currency": "EUR"
}
```

Commission response must **always** be in Euros. Please use a currency rates API ([https://api.exchangerate.host/2021-01-01](https://api.exchangerate.host/2021-01-01)) for transactions in currency other than Euros.

### Commission calculation rules

The **lowest** commission shall be used if there are **multiple** rules matching.

**Rule #1: Default pricing**

By default the price for every transaction is `0.5%` but not less than `0.05€`.

**Rule #2: Client with a discount**

Transaction price for the client with ID of `42` is `0.05€` (_unless other rules set lower commission_).

**Rule #3: High turnover discount**

Client after reaching transaction turnover of `1000.00€` (per month) gets a discount and transaction commission is `0.03€` for the following transactions.

See below an example in CSV format of rules applied to various transactions.

```jsx
client_id, date, amount, currency, commission_amount, commission_currency;
42, 2021 - 01 - 02, 2000.0, EUR, 0.05, EUR;
1, 2021 - 01 - 03, 500.0, EUR, 2.5, EUR;
1, 2021 - 01 - 04, 499.0, EUR, 2.5, EUR;
1, 2021 - 01 - 05, 100.0, EUR, 0.5, EUR;
1, 2021 - 01 - 06, 1.0, EUR, 0.03, EUR;
1, 2021 - 02 - 01, 500.0, EUR, 2.5, EUR;
```

### Testing

Please write at least one unit and one integration test.

### Remarks

- You can use any language and any framework. We expect you to show knowledge of your chosen language's ecosystem (frameworks, 3rd party libraries, etc.)
- Code must follow good practices (such as SOLID, design patterns, etc.) and be easily extendable in case we need to add additional commission calculation rules in the future
- Please include `README.md` with instructions how to run your completed task.
